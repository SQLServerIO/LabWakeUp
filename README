Lab Sleep/Wake up

Just a little program I wrote to manage my windows based lab machines.
Put a single server name per line in servers.txt.
On startup the program will attempt to find all the MAC addresses and add them to ServerMACs.txt.
Now you can choose a server from the drop down and ether shut it down or send it a magic packet to turn it on.
